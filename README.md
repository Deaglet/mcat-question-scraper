# mcat-question-scraper
Project that is an all in one tool to grab as much MCAT study data from the internet and create study tools based on what it has available.

To use, have Docker and Docker Compose installed previously, and then just use `docker-compose up -d` and you should have a locally hosted database, scraper, and frontend, so all the data you need will be gathered by your machine as long as it is running.

Default port is 3002.
